## ðŸ’¡ Overview - What is Recloset?

Hello everyone, we are **Team Recloset** from GDG on Campus Sookmyung in Korea.

The fashion industry is rapidly expanding both in Korea and worldwide.  
With ever-changing global trends, fast fashion has become a popular way for people to keep up.

However, fast fashion comes with significant drawbacks.  
For example, producing a single cotton T-shirt requires about **2,700 liters of water**.  
Beyond water consumption, fast fashion also contributes to environmental pollution, overconsumption, and growing textile waste.

To address these issues, we propose **Recloset**â€”an AI-powered service that helps people recycle or donate clothes in a more sustainable and accessible way.

## ðŸ’¡ Our Solution

Recloset offers a smart and sustainable approach to tackle fast fashion challenges by providing:

1. **AI-powered detection of clothes contamination level**  
   Users can easily analyze the condition of their clothes using AI technology.

2. **Personalized recycling or donation suggestions**  
   Based on the analysis, the service recommends the most suitable actionâ€”recycle or donate.

3. **Eco-friendly action tips**  
   Users receive actionable tips to promote sustainable fashion practices and reduce textile waste.

4. **Location-based service for nearby recycling and donation centers**  
   Easily discover nearby recycling or donation centers using integrated map services.

5. **Donation certification and reward system**  
   Users can certify their donations through the platform, earn rewards, and redeem them for various rewards.
